## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-02

The first installable release: a Windows installer that lays down both halves
of the system, so hosting the room no longer means building from source.

### Added

- **`installer/SimpleChat.iss`** — one Inno Setup 6 installer, two components.
  - `client` is always installed and cannot be unticked: `SimpleChat.exe`,
    `cairo.dll`, the 3,768-file Noto emoji artwork, the licences, a `README.txt`
    and a `client.toml` template placed where `CLIENT_CONFIG` reads it.
  - `server` is **off by default** — most installs are a friend who only wants
    to use the chat. It adds `SimpleChatServer.exe`, the console launchers, the
    hosting guide and a pinned Caddy. Re-running the installer with the box
    ticked promotes a client-only install to a host, which is also how a friend
    becomes a standby host.
  - Start Menu: `SimpleChat` for the window; a `SimpleChat Server` folder with
    Start server, Stop server, Create first admin, Create user, Server log,
    Edit server config, Back up the room, Restore from backup and the hosting
    guide. Optional desktop shortcut.
  - Optional logon scheduled task, registered only when asked for and removed
    on uninstall.
- **`installer/stage_payload.sh`** — assembles the payload from the two lean
  release builds, `simple_cairo`, `simple_shaping` and the templates. It fails
  rather than ship the emoji artwork without its licence.
- **`installer/THIRD-PARTY.md`** — Caddy **v2.11.4** (Apache-2.0) pinned by tag,
  URL, SHA-512 and SHA-256, verified against the upstream checksums file; the
  Noto artwork and cairo pins with their licences.
- **`installer/HOSTING-GUIDE.html`** — hosting written for a non-programmer:
  the two lines that turn hosting on, DuckDNS, router port forwarding, the
  CGNAT dead end and how to recognise it, backups, and the standby-host
  procedure.
- **`--create-user <username> [config.toml]`** on the server executable. There
  is no self-registration: the host mints every account. It mirrors
  `--create-admin` exactly — the same store-direct path over
  `CHAT_SERVICE.create_user`, the same prompting console — and refuses until an
  administrator exists, so the first account on a fresh database is always the
  admin's own.
- Both `--create-admin` and `--create-user` now prompt for a **display name**,
  defaulting to the username. It is read as UTF-8 (`line_read_text`), so a
  Hebrew or Greek name survives when the console is at code page 65001 — which
  the shipped wrappers set. Only the username, confined by the rules to
  a-z/0-9/underscore, ever travels on the command line.
- `SERVER_APP.is_acceptable_display_name` — the gate that discharges
  `CHAT_SERVICE.create_user`'s `valid_display` precondition before the call, so
  a person typing at a console is never a contract violation.
- Assaults: `ordinary_member_created_by_the_host` (the member path, the
  `has_admin` ordering rule and a Hebrew display name round-tripping through
  the store) and `server_app_display_name_gate` (the gate's own cases,
  including the bot marker and bidi overrides). 183 assaults, all green.
- A `CHANGELOG.md`, which the project did not have.

### Changed

- `RUNBOOK.md` §1 — the `--create-admin` invocation is corrected. It showed the
  config path before the flag and a password as an argument; `SERVER_APP.make`
  matches `--create-admin` on **argument 1**, takes the config path as argument
  3, and prompts for the password. As written it would have started the server
  instead of creating an account.

### Notes

- Contracts in `src/` were not touched. The new flag discharges
  `CHAT_SERVICE.create_user`'s existing preconditions; it does not change them.
- `data_dir` in the shipped `server.toml` is **relative** on purpose, and the
  launchers set the working folder. `CADDY_FRONT_DOOR` resolves both
  `caddy.exe` and the Caddyfile against the working directory, and
  `PATH.extended` refuses a rooted argument — a precondition a lean build
  would not catch. See `installer/README.md`.
- Uninstall keeps the room. There is no `[UninstallDelete]`: the data folder,
  `server.toml`, the backups and each member's `client.toml` all survive,
  matching the fleet's stance in `RixGPT.iss` and `RixQwen.iss`.
- Automatic replication between hosts and epoch fencing remain deferred
  (D-017). The standby is a cold, hand-fed copy, and the hosting guide states
  the one rule that keeps it safe: only one server runs at a time.
